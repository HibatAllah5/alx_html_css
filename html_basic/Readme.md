#Asalamo Alaikom everyone, and welcome to my fisrt web page!
So this project is about creating an HTML Webpage. We have created a Repository called "alx_html_css", where you can find a folder called"html_basic".
In this folder, exists three html files and another file containing a picture; the "base_index_html" file, has a title, the "index.html" file contains a webpage with a title, picture, paragraphs, texts, table and finally links.
the "tweets.html" file, has links of twitter in it.
